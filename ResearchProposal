Project team:
Andy Newman
Clinton Idehen
Nathan Teakle
Tim Cook

Why:

What we want to achieve:

Questions to answer:
- What sort of crimes are most prevalent in SA? (c1, c2, c3)
- What postcodes are the least and most safe (least violent crimes)
- What time of the year do most violent crimes occur?
- What crime patterns can be seen over time?
- Has crime rates increased since COVID?


Process:
-Ingest data via URLs rather than download upload csv
-Clean data
-How to handle crimes that do not have postcodes (sensitive crimes)
