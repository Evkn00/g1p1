Project Description:
Uncover crime trends over time per postcode to determine which crimes are on the rise, which areas are increasing in violent crimes

What Data Sets?
https://data.sa.gov.au/data/dataset/crime-statistics
Crime Data sets from last 10 years 2013 - 2022



What we want to achieve:

Questions to answer:
- What sort of crimes are most prevalent in SA? (c1, c2, c3)
- What postcodes are the least and most safe (least violent crimes)
- What time of the year do most violent crimes occur? (add columns for Season, month, DoW?, Xmas, Easter, etc)
- What crime patterns can be seen over time?
- Has crime rates increased since COVID? (regression) (subset 2017 - 2022)



Process:
-Ingest data via URLs rather than download upload csv
  -Merge all files into big df
  -subset for individual questions
  -Add date field
-Clean data
-How to handle crimes that do not have postcodes (sensitive crimes)
